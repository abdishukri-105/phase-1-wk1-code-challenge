# javaScript Code Challenge

Hi, my name is Abdishukri Mohamed, a full-stack software engineering student at Moringa School
This is my first project(code Challenge) at this wonderful School

The project consists of three mini-projects/tests.
 the mini projects are: 
                     1. Student Grade Generator 
                     2. Speed Detector
                     3. Net Salary Calculator
                        

 

## Documentation

### Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)
this a program that takes student marks as inputs.
The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade: 

A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.

This program can be used in secondary schools and Universities 
to automatically Generate student’s grade based on how much they scored on tests

pass in any value to the argument and run node index.js to run this test



### Speed Detector (Toy Problem)

This is a program that takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it prints “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it will give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

For example, if the speed is 80, it will print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function will print: “License suspended”.

 to run this test pass any value in the argument then run node speed.js 

### Net Salary Calculator (Toy Problem)
This is a program whose major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIFDeductions, NSSFDeductions, gross salary, and net salary. 
i Used KRA, NHIF, and NSSF values provided in the link below.

To run this test pass in your salary and benefits in the arguments then run node salary.js
