# javaScript Code Challenge

Hi, my name is Abdishukri Mohamed, a full-stack software engineering student at Moringa School
This is my first project(code Challenge) at this wonderful School

The project consists of three mini-projects/tests.
 the mini projects are: 
                     1. Student Grade Generator 
                     2. Speed Detector
                     3. Net Salary Calculator
                        

 

## Documentation

### Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)
this a program that prompts the user to input student marks.
The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade: 

A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.

This program can be used in secondary schools and Universities 
to automatically Generate student’s grade based on how much they scored on tests



### Speed Detector (Toy Problem)

Sadly, the festive season has seen reports of road accidents dominating news headlines over the years. It has become almost predictable that accident rates will surge during this season. That need not be the case. There is an evident need to do everything to discard this gloomy trend. We should not be fatalistic and resign ourselves to these depressing platitudes and saddening statistics. As a software engineering student at one of the most prestigious boot camps in the country, I was tasked to come up with a tech solution to this menace hence **The speed detector program**

This is a program that takes as input the speed of a
car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70,
it prints “Ok”. Otherwise, for every
5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it will
give the driver one demerit point and print the total 
number of demerit points.

For example, if the speed is 80, it will print: “Points: 2”. 
If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function will print: “License suspended”.

The fear of license suspension will keep the drivers in check and resist the urge to Overspeed 

### Net Salary Calculator (Toy Problem)
This is a program whose major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIFDeductions, NSSFDeductions, gross salary, and net salary. 
i Used KRA, NHIF, and NSSF values provided in the link below.
